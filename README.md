A simple Python program that calculates subnet information from an IPv4 address and the subnet mask.

This program takes a random IPv4 address, Subnet Mask and/or CIDR as input,
returns detailed information about the network, like the network ID, network range, first and last 
useable host addresses,total amount of hosts, total amount of useable hosts, broadcast address,
subnet mask, CIDR notation and binary versions of the IPv4 address, network ID and the subnet mask. 

More features may be added in the future.
